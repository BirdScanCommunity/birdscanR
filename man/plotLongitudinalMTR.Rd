\usage{
plotLongitudinalMTR(
  mtr,
  maxMTR,
  timeRange = NULL,
  plotClass = "allClasses",
  propObsTimeCutoff = 0.2,
  plotSpread = TRUE,
  filePath = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mtr}{data frame with MTR values created by the function ‘computeMTR’.
The MTR data should be computed with one altitude bin, if MTR data with multiple altitude bins are passed to the function, the only the lowest altitude bin is plotted.
The MTR data should be computed per day and night (setting the parameter ‘computePerDayNight’ of the function ‘computeMTR’ to TRUE, otherwise the plot will fail.}

\item{maxMTR}{optional numeric variable, fixes the maximum value of the y-Scale of the plot to the given value. If negative or not set, the y-Scale is auto-scaled.}

\item{timeRange}{optional list of POSIXct vectors length 2, start and end time of the timeranges that should be plotted. The date/time format is “yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm”.
Target timezone has to be added to the times (Figure 14 as example). If not set, all MTR data is plotted in one plot.}

\item{plotClass}{character string with the class of which the MTR data should be plotted. If not set or set to “allClasses”, MTR of all classes will be plotted.}

\item{propObsTimeCutoff}{}

\item{plotSpread}{logical, choose if the spread (first and third quartile) should be plotted.}

\item{filePath}{character string, path of the directory where the plot should be saved. The function ‘savePlotToFile’ is used to save the plots as pngs with an autogenerated filename.}
}
\value{
pngs stored in the directory specified in filePath
}
\description{
Plots the daily MTR values per day and night as a bar plot (Figure 15). For each bar the spread (first and third Quartile) is shown as error bars as well as the numbers of echoes. Periods with no observation are indicated with grey, negative bars.
