  altitudeRange,
  altitudeBinSize,
  timeBins,
  propObsTimeCutoff = 0,

\arguments{
\item{echoes}{dataframe with the echo data from the data list created by the function ‘extractDBData’ or a subset of it created by the function ‘filterEchoData’.}

\item{classSelection}{character string vector with all classes which should be used to calculate the MTR. The MTR and number of Echoes will be calculated for each class as well as for all classes together.}

\item{altitudeRange}{numeric vector of length 2 with the start and end of the altitude range in meter a.g.l.}

\item{altitudeBinSize}{numeric, size of the altitude bins in meter.}

\item{timeBins}{dataframe with the time bins created by the function ‘computeObservationTime’. MTR is computed for each time bin.}

\item{propObsTimeCutoff}{numeric between 0 and 1. If the MTR is computed per day and night, time bins with a proportional observation time smaller than propObsTimeCutoff are ignored when combining the time bins. If the MTR is computed for each time bin, the parameter is ignored.}

\item{computePerDayNight}{logical, TRUE: MTR is computed per day and night FALSE: MTR is computed for each time bin}

\item{computeAltitudeDistribution}{logical, TRUE: compute the mean eight and altitude distribution of MTR for the pre-defined quantiles 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95}

\description{
Computing MTR is time consuming. There are two options to compute MTR values.
The options are selected with the parameter ‘computePerDayNight’.
compute MTR for each time bin: This option computes the MTR for each time bin defined in the time bin dataframe. The time bins that were split due to sunrise/sunset during the time bin will be combined to one bin.
compute MTR per day/night: The time bins of each day and night will be combined and the mean MTR is computed for each day and night. Aside this, the spread (first and third Quartile) for each day and night is computed. The spread is dependent on the chosen time bin duration/amount of time bins.
