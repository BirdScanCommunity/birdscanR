\arguments{
\item{echoData}{dataframe with the echo data from the data list created by the function ‘extractDBData’ or a subset of it created by the function ‘filterEchoData’.}

\item{classSelection}{character string vector with all classes which should be used to calculate the MTR. The MTR and number of Echoes will be calculated for each class as well as for all classes together.}

\item{echoValidator}{logical, NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, so default is FALSE. 2if set to TRUE, echoes labelled by the echo validator as “non-bio scatterer” will be excluded. If set to FALSE, all echoes are included.}

\item{timeRangeTargetTZ}{POSIXct vector of length 2 with start and end time with target timezone. Echoes outside the time range will be excluded.}

\item{timeBinDuration_sec}{numeric, time bin duration in seconds.}

\item{propObsTimeCutoff}{numeric between 0 and 1. If the MTR is computed per day and night, time bins with a proportional observation time smaller than propObsTimeCutoff are ignored when combining the time bins. If the MTR is computed for each time bin, the parameter is ignored.}

\item{timeZone}{character string, timezone of the time bins -> adived to be target timezone}

\item{sunriseSunset}{dataframe with the sunrise/sunset times and the civil twilight times created by the function ‘twilight’ \link{R/twilight.R}}

\item{sunOrCivil}{character string, “sun” (sunrise/sunset times) or “civil” (civil twilight times) to group by day and night. Default if not set is civil twilight.}

\item{computePerDayNight}{logical, TRUE: MTR is computed per day and night FALSE: MTR is computed for each time bin.}

\item{altitudeRange_AGL}{numeric vector of length 2 with the start and end of the altitude range in meter a.g.l.}

\item{altitudeBinSize}{numeric, size of the altitude bins in meter.}

\item{protocolData}{dataframe with the protocol data from the data list created by the function ‘extractDBData’ or a subset of it created by the function ‘filterProtocolData’. Echoes not detected during the listed protocols will be excluded.}

\item{pulseTypeSelection}{character vector, pulse type selection which was used to filter protocols. Used to create the filename, if 'fileName' is not provided. If not set, the pulse type selection will not be appended to the filename.}

\item{rotationSelection}{numeric vector, rotation selection which was used to filter protocols. Used to create the filename, if 'fileName' is not provided. If not set, the rotation selection will not be appended to the filename.}

\item{visibilityData}{dataframe with the visibility data from the data list created by the function ‘extractDBData’.}

\item{manualBlindTimes}{dataframe with the manual blind times created by the function ‘loadManualBlindTimes’}

\item{blindTimeAsMtrZero}{character string vector with the blind time types which should be treated as observation time with MTR zero.}

\item{saveRDS_MTR}{logical, TRUE (default): use the function saveMTR.R to save the output.}

\item{filepath}{character string, path location to save the MTR table, e.g. '~/projectName/MTRtable'.}

\item{dbName}{Name of the data-base.}
}

MTR table
