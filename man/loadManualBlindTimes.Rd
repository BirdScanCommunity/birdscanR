\description{
Load manual blindtimes from csv file.
For the MTR computation the times when the radar was blind have to be known. The radar itself can
be blind in case of a protocol change (blocktime at the beginning of each protocol, usually 60s) or
due to rain/snow or clutter (nearby objects, leaves or similar on radome, etc.). These times are
stored in the visibility table or in the time_bins table in relation to the time bins duration (5min).
To be flexible and not fixed to the 5 min time bins created by the radar, the visibility table is used
in this script.
In addition to the radar blind times, manual blind times can be defined. Manual blind times have to
be defined in a csv file and are loaded with the function ‘loadManualBlindTimes’. A example dataset is
available by running:
\code{data(manualBlindTimes)}
\code{write.csv(manualBlindTimes, file = 'the output file destination', row.names = F)}
The filepath is defined as a global variable ‘manualBlindTimesFile’. A custom file and filepath
can be used instead.
The manual blind times have to be entered with 3 columns:
start time 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss', stop time 'yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss', type.

Example:
2021-01-16 04:15:00,2021-01-16 05:42:00,rain
2021-01-17 16:33:00,2021-01-17 18:04:00,clutter
Manual blind time types can be chosen freely. When computing observation times, it can be decided
if some of the defined manual blind time types should be treated as observed time with MTR zero or
as blind time (e.g. rain). If no file is present or the file is empty, no manual blind times will
be computed.
